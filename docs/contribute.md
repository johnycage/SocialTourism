# Thank you
First of all, thank you for showing interest to contribute. This is an opensource project, not just because I ‚ù§ #opensource but also I neither have skills (of a mobile app developer) nor have enough funds to launch the apps on my own. I heavily rely on contributors to the opensource developers community for this, but can run sponsorship on github to attract the talented developers and collaborate if we have the budget.
