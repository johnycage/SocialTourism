# Thank you
First of all, thank you for showing interest to contribute. This is an opensource project, this is because, not only I ❤ opensource, but also I neither have skills (of a mobile app developer) nor have enough funds to launch the apps on my own. I heavily rely on contributors of the open source developers community for this, but can run sponsorship on github to attract the talented developers and collaborate if we have the budget.

There are 4 ways you can help: 
1. Donate
2. Contribute
3. Promote.
4. Invest

# 1. Donate
Typically, people who find the app useful, wish to make donation but in this case, there are no user here, as it's still under development. The project requires a lot of man-hours and variety of contributors with different set of skills. We may not always get volunteers who'd devote their time and expertise into the project, therefore, we might need to hire freelancers to pace up the work. If you believe in this project and wish this to get launched soon, please consider donating.

If you're from India or if you've a payment app that supports paying UPI, you can scan above QR code to transfer the money. If the QR code is not visible, simply use `pranavamrute@oksbi` as UPI ID for the payment. In transaction details you can add note as `github-st`, further you can send me email about your donation with payment screenshot, so that I can verify and acknowledge.   
If QR code and UPI doesn't work for you, please consider [sponsoring via GitHub platform](https://github.com/sponsors/johnycage). 


# 2. Contribute
1. Star & Fork the repository
2. Check the current progress and unresolved issues and features, which you can work on.
3. Participate in discussion forums, introduce yourself and let us know the skills, tech and platforms you want to contribute to (eg. Drupal, php, content architecture, iOS, android, design, UI/UX etc.) also share your ideas on how project can be build in a better way.
4. local setup
    You may need Drupal, Xcode or Android studio to work on the project locally.
    If you're interested in contributing to backend Drupal development, you can join the Pantheon.io testing workflow. Same code shall be shared on this repository -minus Drupal core packages. 

### Structure
I am planning to use Decoupled Drupal as a backend and shall connect to iOS & Android app as frontend.

# 3. Promote & Share
If you're not in position to donate or contribute to the code (or after donating or contributing to the project), please star and share the project in your network who can contribute and help. Tweet or write a blogpost about it, encourage others to contribute or donate. Spread the word, and help this project to take off.
Thank you.

# 4. Invest
If you're keen on investing in this project with expectations of monetory returns, please email/DM me your proposal. If it matches with what we can deliver, we can discuss further! Please share following details: 
* Amount of money (say US $5,000)
* Duration (how long can you stay invested?)
* ROI expectations (0% interest or 2x etc.)
  
Although investment is the least preferred method for us, as the project has no monetization or revenue model chalked out, I am open to hear out your proposal.
